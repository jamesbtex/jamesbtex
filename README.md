30+ years as a Senior R&D Engineering Electronics Technician with Dean Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Convex Computer and AT+T.
Graduated from DeVry Chicago that started me on a wonderful, fulfilling career. Currently retired due to medical reasons.
I love making music, Art, Photography, Gardening and I used to love Bicycle riding until I became disabled in 2016.
It's been a very tough ride since then, just trying to keep on learning, and staying positive.
